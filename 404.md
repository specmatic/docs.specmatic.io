# 🔍 404: Contract Not Found

**Oops!** The endpoint you're looking for doesn't exist — or maybe the contract changed and the consumer didn't get the memo.

Welcome to the dark side of dynamic routing. But don't worry, Specmatic's got your back (just… not *here*).

---

## 🚧 Possible Root Causes

- Someone changed the API spec and forgot to publish the contract. Classic.
- This page was mocked... and never implemented.
- You hit a flaky test in production. It happens.
- The request is valid. The response? Not so much.
- Or maybe you just mistyped the URL — we've all been there.

---

## 🔧 Next Steps

- 🔁 [Return to Home](https://specmatic.io) — our landing page *does* exist. We tested it.
- 📚 [Read the Docs](https://docs.specmatic.io) — for contract clarity and peace of mind.
- 🐛 [Report an Issue](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic/issues) — unless this is the issue.

## 🧘‍♂️ Fun Fact

Specmatic helps your services talk to each other. Unlike this page, which clearly ghosted your request.

> *P.S. If this 404 page is the only thing working in your app, maybe it's time to run Specmatic in CI.*

👻 _This page is proudly mock-driven, auto-generated, and contract-compliant. Mostly._
