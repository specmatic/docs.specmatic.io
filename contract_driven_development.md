# What Contract Driven Development
{: .fs-9}

**Contract Driven Development** leverages API Specifications (such as [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) and more) as Executable Contracts to shift-left identification contract compatiblity issues.

At a high level, our goal is to
* Significantly improve time to market for features
* Independently develop and deploy microservices and microfrontends
* Drastically reduce the dependency on integration testing
* Foster better API designs and collaboration between teams by facilitating communication through industry standard API Specifications such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, etc.

Here is a quick explainer video.
