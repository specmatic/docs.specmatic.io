## Introduction

Specmatic supports service virtualization, contract testing and backward compatibility for GraphQL APIs based on [GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language)](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-part1/03-schema-definition-language-sdl) files, similar to its support for REST (OpenAPI).

## What Can You Achieve with Specmatic's GraphQL Support?

With Specmatic GraphQL support you will be to leverage your GraphQL SDL files as executable contracts.

1. Intelligent Service Virtualisation: Stub out GraphQL services for testing and development
2. Contract Testing: Validate requests and responses against your GraphQL SDL files
3. Backward Compatibility Checks: Compare two versions of your GraphQL SDL files to identify breaking changes without writing any code
4. Central Contract Repo: Store your GraphQL SDL files in central Git repo which will serve as single source of truth for both providers and consumers
5. API resiliency : Generate negative and edge cases to verify the resiliency of your API impementation again based on your GraphQL SDL files.

## Quick Start

Here is a [sample project](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-graphql-java) which has detailed animated architecture diagram along with explanation about how we are isolating the System Under Test during Contract Tests.

[Clone the project](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-graphql-java) and follow instructions in README.

## Detailed explanation

### Using your GraphQL files as your API Contracts from Central Contract Repository

1. Store your GraphQL SDL files in a central repository for easy access and version control.
2. Create a `specmatic.yaml` file in the root of your project to reference these contracts. Here's an example:

```yaml
contract_repositories:
  - type: git
    repository: https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts.git
    provides:
      - io/specmatic/examples/store/graphql/products_bff.graphqls
    consumes:
      - io/specmatic/examples/store/openapi/api_order_v3.yaml
```

Make sure to update the `repository`, `provides` and `consumes` sections to reflect your actual contract repository and .proto file locations.

### Using externalised examples as test / stub data to be used as part of contract tests and service virtualization respectively

Say suppose you have a GraphQL SDL file as shown below.

```graphql
enum ProductType {
  gadget
  book
  food
  other
}

type Query {
  findAvailableProducts(type: ProductType!, pageSize: Int): [Product]
}

type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  inventory: Int!
  type: ProductType!
}
```

In order substitute appropriate values you can create a example YAML files that has test/stub data pertaining to the `findAvailableProducts` query.

```
request: 
  httpHeaders:
    X-region: north-west 
  body: |
    query {
        findAvailableProducts(type: gadget, pageSize: 10) { id name inventory type }
    }

response: [
  {
    "id": "10",
    "name": "The Almanac",
    "inventory": 10,
    "type": "book"
  },
  {
    "id": "20",
    "name": "iPhone",
    "inventory": 15,
    "type": "gadget"
  }
]
```

This file can either be stored in directory that is colocated with the GraphQL SDL file with the naming convention `<GraphQL SDL file without extension>_examples` or alternatively you can pass it as an argument programmatically or through CLI args while running tests or service virtualisation.

Let us now take deeper look at the external example format.
* At the top level we have two YAML root nodes called `request` and `response`
* `request` can take below params
  * Under `body` you can have either `query`s or `mututation`s with exact values where necessary
  * Under `headers` you can add your `HTTP` headers
* `response` accepts a JSON syntax for responses for readability, syntax highlighting and also aid copy and paste of real responses from actual application logs etc.

### Using the Docker Image

So far in the above explanation the sample project is invoking Specmatic GraphqlQL support programmatically. However if you wish to run the same from CLI then below Docker image wraps the same Specmatic GraphQL capabilities.

[`znsio/specmatic-graphql-trial`](https://hub.docker.com/r/znsio/specmatic-graphql-trial)

Also the Specmatic GraphQL Docker image, by nature, is completely language and tech stack agnostic.

#### Starting the Stub / Service Virtualization Service

To start the stub service, use the following command:

```shell
docker run --network host -v "$(pwd)/specmatic.yml:/usr/src/app/specmatic.yml" znsio/specmatic virtualize --port=8090
```

This command mounts your local `specmatic.yaml` file into the container and exposes the stub service on port 8090. And uses the GraphQL SDL files listed under `consumes` section for starting up a service virtualisation server.

#### Running Tests

To run contract test:

```shell
docker run --network host -v "$(pwd)/specmatic.yml:/usr/src/app/specmatic.yml" -e SPECMATIC_GENERATIVE_TESTS=true znsio/specmatic-graphql-trial test --port=8080
```

This command mounts your `specmatic.yaml` file and runs tests against a service running on port 8080 by generating GraphQL requests based on the GrapqhQL SDL files listed under `provides` section.

## Sample Projects

We have created sample projects to demonstrate the above in different languages and scenarios, please follow the link for the latest sample projects 

* [GraphQL sample projects](https://specmatic.io/documentation/sample_projects.html#graphql)

These projects provide practical examples of how to integrate Specmatic GraphQL support into your workflow, including setting up stubs, writing tests, and handling different languages, frameworks and running them on CI like Github actions.
