## Report Format

Qontract strives to pinpoint the location of the error, and tell you exactly what went amiss there.

A report contain 3 components:
1. the scenario
2. the path to the error
3. details about the error

## Error In The Request

Let's assume this contract is running as a stub:

```gherkin
#Filename: basic.qontract
Feature: Basic contract

Scenario: Basic API
When POST /basic
And request-body (number)
Then status 200
```

Here's the output of a curl command that invokes the stub API.

```bash
➜  ~ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d hi http://localhost:9000/basic
In scenario "Basic API"
>> REQUEST.BODY

Expected number, actual was "hi"
```

Let's take this apart.

**Line 1: Scenario name**

```
In scenario "Basic API"
```

This contains the scenario name.

**Line 2: Path to the error**

```
>> REQUEST.BODY
```

The error path pinpoints the location of the error. In this case, the error was found in the request body.

**Line 3 onwards: details about the error**

```
Expected number, actual was "hi"
```

Qontract helpfully tells you that it expected a number, but the actual value was "hi". It's quoted to indicate that the value was a string.

## Error in JSON request

Let's assume this contract is running as a stub:

```gherkin
Feature: Random API
  Scenario: Random number
    When POST /number
    And request-body
      | data | (number) |
    Then status 200
    And response-body (number)
```

Here's the output of a curl command that invokes the stub API.

```bash
➜  files git:(master) ✗ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"data": "hi"}' http://localhost:9000/number
In scenario "Random number"
>> REQUEST.BODY.data

Expected number, actual was string: "hi"
```

Now let's take this apart.

**Line 1: Scenario name**

```
In scenario "Random number"
```

**Line 2: Path to the error**

```
>> REQUEST.BODY.data
```

The path indicates that the error is in the request body. `REQUEST` and `BODY` are Qontract keywords.

`data` is inside REQUEST.BODY. This indicates that the request body is a **json object containing the key data**.

**Line 3 onwards: Details about the error**

```
Expected number, actual was string: "hi"
```

This line indicates that the value at key `data` should be a number, but was the string "hi".
