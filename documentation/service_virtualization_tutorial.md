## Pre-requisites

- Create a directory named `specmatic` in your home directory.
- [Download the latest version of Specmatic](/download.html) into the `specmatic` directory.
- Install JRE 17.
- `cd` into the `specmatic` directory and run the command `java -jar specmatic.jar --version`. This should print out the version of Specmatic.

## Inline Examples

Create the following files in the `specmatic` directory.

- Create a file named `employees.yaml` in the `specmatic` directory with the following contents.

  ```yaml
  openapi: 3.0.0
  info:
    title: Employees
    version: '1.0'
  servers: []
  paths:
    '/employees':
      post:
        summary: ''
        requestBody:
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Employee'
              examples:
                CREATE_EMPLOYEE_SUCCESS:
                  value:
                    name: Jill Doe
                    department: Engineering
                    designation: Director
        responses:
          '201':
            description: Employee Created Response
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                  required:
                    - id
                examples:
                  CREATE_EMPLOYEE_SUCCESS:
                    value:
                      id: 10
  components:
    schemas:
      Employee:
        type: object
        required:
          - name
          - department
          - designation
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
          department:
            type: string
          designation:
            type: string
  ```

- In the same directory, create a file named `specmatic.yaml` in the `specmatic` directory with the following contents:

  ```yaml
  contract_repositories:
    - type: filesystem
      consumes:
        - employees.yaml
  ```

- `cd` into the `specmatic` directory and run the following command:

  ```shell
  java -jar specmatic.jar stub
  ```

- Wait until the stub starts.
- In a new tab, run the following curl command:

  ```shell
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Jill Doe", "department": "Engineering", "designation": "Director"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

- You should get the following response back:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 10
  }
  ```

In the specification above, the request and response both contain examples with the same name, `CREATE_EMPLOYEE_SUCCESS`. Specmatic stub correlates the two, and returns value in the response example when it the value in the request example is received

## Add External Examples

- Run the `examples` command:

  ```shell
  java -jar specmatic.jar examples employees.yaml
  ```

- You'll see it writing out a file into the `employees_examples` directory
  - The directory name MUST follow the format `<spec file name without extension>_examples`.
  - The file name indicates the operation it was generated from, but is free-form and need follow no convention.

- Open the file, and you'll see this:

  ```json
  {
      "http-request": {
          "path": "/employees",
          "method": "POST",
          "headers": {
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
          },
          "body": {
              "name": "Jill Doe",
              "department": "Engineering",
              "designation": "Director"
          }
      },
      "http-response": {
          "status": 201,
          "body": {
              "id": 479
          },
          "status-text": "Created",
          "headers": {
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- This is an external example. It is loaded by Specmatic automatically when the stub starts.
- In the request, modify the value of `name` to "Jack Sprat", and the value of `department` to "Sales", and in the response, modify the value of `id` to 20, like so:

  ```json
  {
      "http-request": {
          "path": "/employees",
          "method": "POST",

          "headers": {
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
          },
          
          "body": {
              "name": "Jack Sprat",
              "department": "Sales",
              "designation": "Director"
          }
      },
      "http-response": {
          "status": 201,
          
          "body": {
              "id": 20
          },
          
          "headers": {
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
          }

          "status-text": "Created",
      }
  }
  ```

- Kill the stub (`Ctrl+C`) if it is running, and start it again.
  - You will see that file name is mentioned in the startup logs.
- In a new tab, run the following curl command:

  ```shell
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Jack Sprat", "department": "Sales", "designation": "Director"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

- Specmatic stub will response with this payload:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 20
  }
  ```

**Note:** You may add more example files into the `employees_examples` directory. There is no limit to the number of example files that can be added.

## Intelligent service virtualisation - Example cannot go out of sync

What happens if an example goes out of sync with the spec? Let's see.

- Copy the example JSON file to a new file in the `_examples` directory.
- Modify the value of `name` in the request to "Janet", and the value of `id` in the response to "abc123" (remember, `id` is an integer according to the specification), like so:

  ```json
  {
    "http-request": {
      "path": "/employees",
      "method": "POST",

      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      
      "body": {
        "name": "Janet",
        "department": "Sales",
        "designation": "Director"
      }
    },
    "http-response": {
      "status": 201,
        
      "body": {
        "id": "abc123"
      },
      
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }

      "status-text": "Created",
    }
  }
  ```

- It's a mistake that anyone can make, especially in more complicated APIs.
- Start the stub.
- You'll see the following error message in the log:

  ```text
  In scenario ". Response: Employee Created Response"
  API: POST /employees -> 201

    >> REQUEST.BODY.department

        Contract expected string but stub contained 10 (number)
  ```

- In this way, Specmatic give early feedback whenever eamples are out of line with the spec.


- Specmatic's stub rejected the example because of the mismatch. Prove this by running the following curl command:

  ```shell
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Janet", "department": "Sales", "designation": "Director"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

- You'll get this response:

  ```json
  {
      "id": 783
  }
  ```

- Specmatic stub had rejected the example, but the request does match the specification. So a structure matching the specification with random values is generated and returned.

## Examples matching any value matching the specification

- Create a new file in the `employees_examples` directory named `any_name.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "http-request": {
      "path": "/employees",
      "method": "POST",

      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      
      "body": {
        "name": "(string)",
        "department": "Sales",
        "designation": "Director"
      }
    },
    "http-response": {
      "status": 201,
        
      "body": {
        "id": 30
      },
      
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }

      "status-text": "Created",
    }
  }
  ```

- Execute the following command, which has the `name` "Janet":

  ```shell
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Janet", "department": "Engineering", "designation": "Director"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

- You'll get this response:

  ```json
  {
      "id": 30
  }
  ```

- Modify the `name` to "Justin", or any other name, and you'll get the same response.
- Modify the value of `department` to "Facilities", and you'll get a randomised response.
- This example will match a request with any name, but the value of `department` in the request must be "Engineering", and the value of `designation` must be "Director".

## Values matching regular expressions

For specifications where the request body is a string with some custom format, you can use regular expressions in the example.

Let's use a new specification named employee_sql.yaml:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: SQL Query API
  version: '1.0'
paths:
  /employee-query:
    post:
      summary: Run an SQL query
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          text/plain:
            schema:
              type: string
              description: The SQL query to be executed
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful execution of the SQL query
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                required:
                  - id
                  - name
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: integer
                    description: The employee ID
                  name:
                    type: string
                    description: The employee name

```

- Create a directory named `employee_sql_examples` and insite that create a file named `select_employee_by_id.json`:
- Create a new file in the `employees_examples` directory named `names_starting_with_j.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "http-request": {
      "path": "/employee-query",
      "method": "POST",

      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      
      "body": "(string)",
      "bodyRegex": "^SELECT .*id = 1$"
    },
    "http-response": {
      "status": 200,
        
      "body": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe"
      },
      
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },

      "status-text": "OK"
    }
  }
  ```

- Add `employee_sql.yaml` to the `consumes` list in `specmatic.yaml`, like so:

  ```yaml
  contract_repositories:
    - type: filesystem
      consumes:
        - employees.yaml
        - employee_sql.yaml
  ```

- Run the following curl command:

  ```shell
  curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d 'SELECT * from employee where id = 1' http://localhost:9000/employee-query
  ```

- You'll get this response:

  ```json
  {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe"
  }
  ```

- Try changing the table to anything else. Just make sure that the query starts with `SELECT` and ends with `id = 1`, as per the regex in `bodyRegex` in the example, and you'll get the same response.

## Correlated request and response values

Response values can be correlated with request values in the following ways.

Update employees.yaml specification with the following content:

  ```yaml
  openapi: 3.0.0
  info:
    title: Employees
    version: '1.0'
  servers: []
  paths:
    /employees:
      patch:
        requestBody:
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Employee'
        responses:
          '200':
            description: Employee Updated Response
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/EmployeeResponse'
  components:
    schemas:
      Employee:
        type: object
        required:
          - employeeCode
        properties:
          employeeCode:
            type: string
          name:
            type: string
          department:
            type: string
          designation:
            type: string
      EmployeeResponse:
        allOf:
          - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Employee'
          - type: object
            required:
              - id
              - employeeCode
            properties:
              id:
                type: integer
              employeeCode:
                type: string
  ```

### Direct substitution

- Since we have changed the spec, remove all the examples in `employees_examples`, as they will now be invalid.

- In the `employees_examples` directory, add a file named `direct_substitution.json` with the following content:

  ```json
  {
      "http-request": {
          "method": "PATCH",
          "path": "/employees",
          "body": {
              "employeeCode": "(EMPLOYEE_CODE:string)",
              "name": "(NAME:string)"
          }
      },
      "http-response": {
          "status": 200,
          "body": {
              "id": 10,
              "name": "$(NAME)",
              "employeeCode": "$(EMPLOYEE_CODE)",
              "department": "Sales",
              "designation": "Associate"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Execute the following `curl` command:

  ```shell
  curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Janet", "employeeCode": "abc123"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

- You'll get this response:

  ```json
  {
      "id": 10,
      "name": "Janet",
      "employeeCode": "abc123",
      "department": "Sales",
      "designation": "Associate"
  }
  ```

The syntax that you see in `name` in the example request tells Specmatic to save the value of name in the curl request (or any incoming request) to a variable called `NAME`, and the syntax under `name` in the example response tells Specmatic where to use the value of the variable `NAME` in the response that it must send back.

Try the same curl command again but modify `name` or `employeeCode`. You'll see that `name` and `employeeCode` sent in the request will be reflected in the response.

### Data lookup

If the multiple values in the response depends on the name, and they are all different, the data lookup approach would come in handy.

Add a new file into the `employees_examples` directory named `data_lookup.json` with the following contents:

  ```json
  {
      "http-request": {
          "method": "PATCH",
          "path": "/employees",
          "body": {
              "employeeCode": "(EMPLOYEE_CODE:string)",
              "department": "(DEPARTMENT:string)"
          }
      },
      "http-response": {
          "status": 200,
          "body": {
              "id": 10,
              "employeeCode": "$(EMPLOYEE_CODE)",
              "name": "Jack",
              "department": "$(DEPARTMENT)",
              "designation": "$(dataLookup.departments[DEPARTMENT].designation)"
          }
      },
      "dataLookup": {
          "departments": {
              "Sales": {
                  "designation": "Associate"
              },
              "Engineering": {
                  "designation": "Manager"
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Look closely at the syntax of the value of `designation` in the response.
  - Explanation: The value of `designation` will be arrived at by looking up in the `dataLookup.departments`, dereferencing the dictionary based on `DEPARTMENT` (which came from the value of `department` in the response), and in the resulting dictionary, the value of `designation` is used.
  - Note that the names `dataLookup`, `departments`, `designation` are all free-form. There are no conventions to be followed.
- Execute this curl command:

```shell
curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"department": "Sales", "employeeCode": "abc123"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
```

- You'll get the following response, in which the value of `designation` is "Associate", as per the lookup.

  ```json
  {
      "id": 10,
      "name": "Jack",
      "employeeCode": "abc123",
      "department": "Sales",
      "designation": "Associate"
  }
  ```

- Execute this curl command:

  ```shell 
  curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"department": "Engineering"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

- You will get the following response, in which the value of `designation` is "Manager", as per the lookup.

  ```json
  {
    "id": 10,
    "name": "Jack",
    "employeeCode": "abc123",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "designation": "Manager"
  }
  ```

- The value of `designation` in the response varies based on the value of `department` in tihe request.

## Partial examples

If you are only interested in matching certain values in the request, you can setup a partial example.

For example, suppose I want to setup a response for all requests with `name` set to "George". I don't care about the others, let them be what they may.

- Create a file in `employees_examples` named partial_request.json, with the following contents:

  ```json
  {
      "partial": {
          "http-request": {
              "method": "PATCH",
              "path": "/employees",
              "body": {
                  "name": "George"
              }
          },
          "http-response": {
              "status": 200,
              "body": {
                  "id": 10,
                  "employeeCode": "abc123",
                  "name": "George",
                  "department": "Sales",
                  "designation": "Manager"    
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Start the stub, and execute the following curl command:

```shell
curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "George", "employeeCode": "abc12dd3"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
```

- You'll get this response:

```json
{
    "id": 10,
    "employeeCode": "abc123",
    "name": "George",
    "department": "Sales",
    "designation": "Manager"
}
```

- Try the same but vary status code. As long as the `name` is "George", you will get the above response.

## Default values using a dictionary

If you don't care about the specific response values when formulating the example, but want them to be injected later on, depending on the environment, you can use the dictionary feature.

- Create a new example file in the `employees_examples` directory named `lookup_dictionary.json` with the following contents:

  ```json
  {
      "http-request": {
          "method": "PATCH",
          "path": "/employees",
          "body": {
              "employeeCode": "pqrxyz",
              "name": "Jamie"
          }
      },
      "http-response": {
          "status": 200,
          "body": {
              "id": 10,
              "employeeCode": "pqrxyz",
              "name": "Jamie",
              "department": "(string)",
              "designation": "(string)"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Update your `specmatic.yaml` file to declare the dictionary:

  ```yaml
  contract_repositories:
    - type: filesystem
      consumes:
        - employees.yaml
  stub:
    dictionary: ./dictionary.json
  ```

- Start the stub and execute this curl command:

  ```shell
  curl -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "Jamie", "employeeCode": "pqrxyz"}' http://localhost:9000/employees
  ```

You'll get this response:

  ```json
  {
      "id": 10,
      "name": "Jamie",
      "employeeCode": "pqrxyz",
      "department": "Sales",
      "designation": "Associate"
  }
  ```

Note that we did not provide "Sales" or "Associate" as the value of "department" or "designation" respectively. Those were lookuped up in the dictionary.

## Last-in First-out Precedence

It's possible that a request may match more than one of the above examples. In general, the examples are matched in last-in first-out order. The first example matching the incoming request is selected, and it's response substitutions are resolved and returned.

Mov## SSL / Https  stubbing

There are multiple ways to run the Specmatic Stub with SSL.

### Autogenerated Cert Store

This is the quickest approach.

```shell
java -jar specmatic.jar stub --httpsKeyStoreDir=<directory to create keysore> --port=443 product-api.yaml
```

This will create a `specmatic.jks` file in the dir that you mentioned above and you can now access the stub over https.

### Bring your own key store

If you already have a keystore and self signed certificate you can pass it to Specmatic through below command options.

```shell
% specmatic stub --help
...
      --httpsKeyStore=<keyStoreFile>
                             Run the proxy on https using a key in this store
      --httpsKeyStorePassword=<keyStorePassword>
                             Run the proxy on https, password for pre-existing
                               key store
      --httpsPassword=<keyPassword>
                             Key password if any
```

## Dynamic expectations (a.k.a. dynamic stubbing or mocking) - Setting expecations over Specmatic Http API

### Context
It is not always possible to know ahead of time what expecation data needs to be setup. Example: Consider below scenario
* Let us say our system under test needs to lookup the SKU value from another service (over which we do not have control or cannot mock) before creating products
* In this scenario we will be unable to create the expectation json file with any specific value of SKU since we will only know this at test runtime / dynamically

**Dynamic Stubs** are helpful in such scenarios which involve a **work flow** with multiple steps where the input of a step depends on output of its previous step.

### Expectations Http Endpoint

Specmatic stub server can accept expectation json through below http endpoint.

```shell
http://localhost:9000/_specmatic/expectations
```

Please see <a href="/documentation/SpecmaticExpectations-postman_collection.json" download>postman collection</a> for reference.

Specmatic will verify these expecations against the OpenAPI Specifications and will only return a 2xx response if they are as per API Specifications. Specmatic returns 4xx reponse if the expectation json is not as per the OpenAPI Specifications.

### Anatomy of a Component / API Test

<img alt="Anatomy of a Component / API Test" src="https://specmatic.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Contact-as-stub.png" />

Please see this [video](https://youtu.be/U5Agz-mvYIU?t=998) for reference.

The above image shows how Specmatic Smart Mocking fits into your Component Test. A good component test isolates the system / component under test from its dependencies. Here Specmatic is emulating the dependencies of the mobile application thereby isolating it.

**API Tests are just Component Tests where the System Under Test is a Service / API**. Here is an [example](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-java/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/com/component/orders/ApiTests.kt) of how you can leverage Specmatic dynamic mocking in an API Test. Below are the pieces involved.
* **System Under Test** - [Find Available Products Service](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-java/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/com/component/orders/controllers/Products.kt) - Invokes products API to get all products and filters out products where inventory is zero.
* **Dependency** - Products API mocked by Specmatic. Specmatic is setup to leverage [OpenAPI Specification of Products API](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts/blob/main/io/specmatic/examples/store/openapi/api_order_v3.yaml) in the [central contract repo](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts) through [specmatic.yaml](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-java/blob/main/specmatic.yaml) configuration.

Let us analyse each phase of this API test.
* **Arrange** - In this step, we setup Specmatic stub server with expectation json through Specmatic http endpoint to emulate the Products API to return expected response. We also verify that Specmatic has accepted this expectation data by asserting that the response code is 2xx. This confirms that are our expectation data is in line with the OpenAPI Specification of Products OpenAPI Specification.
* **Act** - Here the test invokes System Under Test to exercise the functionality we need to test. This inturn results in the System Under Test invoking its dependency (Products Service) which is being emulated by Specmatic. Specmatic returns the response we have setup in the previous step to the System Under Test. System Under Test processes this data and responds to API Test.
* **Assert** - We now verify the response from System Under Test to ascertain if it has returned the correct response.

## Examples as expectations

If an example in the request and an example in the response of a particular path have the same name, Specmatic will use them together as a stub expectation. It will be the equivalent of creating a stub.json file, specifying the path, method and the request body under http-request, and the status and response body body under http-response.

This only works for request and response JSON bodies right now. It does not work for headers, query params, path params, multi part or form fields. If any of those need to be stubbed out, use the stub.json file or dynamic expectations. Support for these will be added later.

For example, take the following API specification:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Employees
  version: '1.0'
servers: []
paths:
  '/employees':
    post:
      summary: ''
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Employee'
            examples:
              CREATE_EMPLOYEE_SUCCESS:
                value:
                  name: Jill Doe
                  department: Engineering
                  designation: Director
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Employee Created Response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: string
                required:
                  - id
              examples:
                CREATE_EMPLOYEE_SUCCESS:
                  value:
                    id: 10
components:
  schemas:
    Employee:
      title: Employee
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - name
        - department
        - designation
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        department:
          type: string
        designation:
          type: string
```

If you stub it out, right out the gate, with no further `_examples` files or any effort, if you send POST /znsio/specmatic/employees with a JSON object `{"name": "Jill Doe", "department": "Engineering", "designation": "Directory"}`, you'll get back `{"id": 10}`. Note how both the request and response exist as examples in the specification, and are being used directly as expectations with no further effort.

Note that this currently works only for JSON request and response payloads. Support for other parts such as headers, query parameters, etc will be implemented soon.

## Programmatically starting stub server within tests

{% tabs virtualization %}
{% tab virtualization java %}
If your tests are written in a JVM based language, you can start and stop the stub server within your tests programmatically.

Add `specmatic-core` jar dependency with scope set to test since this need not be shipped as part of your production deliverable.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.specmatic</groupId>
    <artifactId>specmatic-core</artifactId>
    <version>{{ site.latest_release }}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Now you can import the utilty to create the stub server. Below code snippets are in Kotlin. However the overall concept is the same across all JVM languages such as Clojure, Scala or plain Java.

```kotlin
import io.specmatic.stub.createStub
```

This utility can now be used in your test ```setup``` / ```beforeAll``` method to start the stub server. Specmatic automatically looks for your [Specmatic configuration](/documentation/configuration.html) file in project root directory / classpath to locate your API Specification files that need to run as part of the stub server.

```kotlin
@BeforeAll
@JvmStatic
fun setUp() {
    stub = createStub()
}
```

We can now programmatically set [dynamic expectations](/documentation/service_virtualization_tutorial.html#dynamic-mocking---setting-expecations-over-specmatic-http-api) on the ```stub``` with the ```setExpectation(<expectationJson>)``` method where ```<expecationJson>``` is in the same format as [static expecations](/documentation/service_virtualization_tutorial.html#fix-the-response-to-products10)

```java
stub.setExpectation(expectationJson);
```

If you have several such JSON expectation files that you would like to setup at once, you can pass a list of files or dir containing these expectation JSON files while creating the stub.

```kotlin
httpStub = createStub(listOf("./src/test/resources"))
```

The above `createStub()` function creates your Specmatic HTTP stub with default host, port, etc. Below is an example with all values being passedin 

```kotlin
@BeforeAll
@JvmStatic
fun setUp() {
    stub = createStub(listOf("./src/test/resources"), "localhost", 8090, strict = true)
}
```

The last parameter (`strict = true`), enables **strict** mode where Specmatic HTTP Stub will only respond to requests where expectations have been set. For any other requests, `400 Bad Request` is returned.

And subsequently once your tests are done, you can shutdown the stub server as part of your ```teardown``` / ```afterAll``` method.

```kotlin
@AfterAll
@JvmStatic
fun tearDown() {
    service?.stop()
    stub.close()
}
```

Here is a complete example of Specmatic Contract Tests that leverages the above technique.

[Kotlin Example](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-java/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/com/component/orders/contract/ContractTests.kt)

Please note that this is only a utility for the purpose of convenience in Java projects. Other programming languages can simply run the Specmatic standalone executable just as easily. If you do happpen to write a thin wrapper and would like to contribute the same to the project, please refer to our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

{% endtab %}
{% tab virtualization python %}
If your tests are written in Python, you can start and stop the stub server within your tests programmatically.

1. **Install the Specmatic Python library**: Use pip, a package installer for Python, to install the Specmatic library.

   ```bash
   pip install specmatic
   ```

2. **Run Tests with a Stub**: If you want to run the tests with a stub, you can do so like this:

   ```python
   import os
   from specmatic.core.specmatic import Specmatic
   from your_project import app
   PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   app_host = "127.0.0.1"
   app_port = 5000
   stub_host = "127.0.0.1"
   stub_port = 5000
   expectation_json_file = PROJECT_ROOT_DIR + '/test/data/expectation.json'

   Specmatic() \
       .with_project_root(PROJECT_ROOT_DIR) \
       .with_stub(stub_host, stub_port, [expectation_json_file]) \
       .with_wsgi_app(app, app_host, app_port) \
       .test(TestContract) \
       .run()
   ```

   In this example, we are passing an instance of wsgi app like flask. `stub_host`, `stub_port`, and `expectation_json_file` are the the host and port for the stub server, and the path to a JSON file containing expectations for the stub, respectively. Replace `app` with your Flask application object.

   Here are complete example of [Specmatic stub server](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-bff-python/blob/main/test/test_contract.py) usage in Python.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Transient expectations (a.k.a. transient stubs)

A transient mock disappears immediately after it has been exercised.

### Setting transient expectations

For example, create this stub file for products-api.yaml contract:

```json
{
  "http-stub-id": "123",
  "http-request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/storestatus",
  },
  "http-response": {
    "status": 200,
    "body": "open"
  }
}
```

Make an HTTP request to http://localhost:9000/storestatus with the GET method. The response says "open".

Now try the same request again. The response is a randomized string.

This is useful particularly when there are no distinguishing features of the request like in the above example, and we need to simulate a succession of calls to that API giving different responses.

### Clearing transient expectations

If the test fails and you need to start a new run of the test, you may need to clear all the transient mocks so that the two tests do not step on eachother's toes.

To do that, make an API call to the path /_specmatic/http-stub/<http-stub-token> with the DELETE verb.

To clear the transient mock in the above example, you would call http://localhost:9000/_specmatic/http-stub/123 with the DELETE verb.

## Matching the request body with regular expressions

When a part of the string varies while the rest remains the same (e.g. a timestamp in the string that changes with each test), we use a regex to match the string. This lets us match exactly the parts of the string that do not change, while allowing for parts of the string to vary.

```json
{
  "http-request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/data",
    "body": "(string)",
    "bodyRegex": "^hello (.*)$"
  },
  "http-response": {
    "status": 200,
    "body": {
      "id": 40
    }
  }
}
```

This would match a request with body `hello world`, but would not match `hi world`.

Against the same contract, we could set another expectation with `requestBodyRegex` value `^Good (.*)$` which would match `Good morning` but not `What a great morning`.

A regular expression could be added as a constraint to the contract, but it would apply to all stubs. This is not a contract-level constraint. It's meant to be used when specific scenarios are hard to match because parts of the string are generated by the application and are hard to predict.

## Delay Simulation

Specmatic allows granular control over simulating a slow response for certain requests.

Let us create another expectation file on the same lines as [expectation.json](/documentation/service_virtualization_tutorial.html#fix-the-response-to-products10) in the products-api_examples folder and call it expectation-with-delay.json with below content.

```yaml
{
  "http-request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/products/11"
  },
  "http-response": {
    "status": 200,
    "body": {
      "name": "Slow Soap",
      "sku": "slow1234"
    }
  },
  "delay-in-seconds": 3
}
```

We have set the delay to 3 seconds here. Once the Specmatic stub server has loaded this expectation, time the request for product id 11 and you should see a 3 second delay.

```shell
% time curl http://localhost:9000/products/11
{
    "name": "Slow Soap",
    "sku": "slow1234"
}curl http://localhost:9000/products/11  0.01s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 3.082 total
```

All other requests, other than the specific request (product id 11) where a delay has been setup, will continue to behave as usual.

## Externalised response generation

There may be circumstances where we need to compute the response or part of it based on the request in the expectation. Here is an example.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: New Feature
  version: "1"
paths:
  /triple/{value}:
    get:
      summary: three times
      parameters:
      - name: value
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: number
      responses:
        "200":
          description: three times
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: number
```

This OpenAPI specification expects given input to be multiplied by three. It may not be possible to create expectation for each individual number. In this can we can create an expecation that can call an external command to which it can pass the incoming request and then return the value generated by that external command.

```json
{
    "http-request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/triple/(value:number)"
    },
    "http-response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": "10",
        "externalisedResponseCommand": "<path to>/response.sh"
    }
}
```

In the above expecation file since we are providing the ```externalisedResponseCommand```, Specmatic will ignore the data inside ```http-reponse body```. Instead it call the command (```response.sh```) that is mentioned in ```externalisedResponseCommand``` and pass the incoming request as a environment variable ```SPECMATIC_REQUEST```.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

value=${SPECMATIC_REQUEST:20:1}

cat << EOF
{
    "status": 200,
    "body": $((value * 3)),
    "status-text": "OK",
    "headers": {
        "X-Specmatic-Result": "success",
        "Content-Type": "text/plain"
    }
}
EOF
```

The above shell script is just an example, the external command can be any executable / script / program which can read an environment variable. The example shell script here is reading the path parameter and multiplying it by three. The response of this script / command is returned as the response to the request.

## Hooks

Specmatic can modify the specification before loading it.

Let's see a quick example of a frontend that connects to the backend API through an API gateway.

Here is an API specification for a products API.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Sample Product API
  version: 0.0.1
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:8080
    description: Local
paths:
  /products:
    get:
      summary: Get Products
      description: Get Products
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: id
          schema:
            type: number
          required: true
          description: Numerical Product Id
        - in: header
          name: X-internal-id
          schema:
            type: string
          required: true
          description: Internal customer id
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Returns Product With Id
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  required:
                    - name
                    - sku
                  properties:
                    name:
                      type: string
                    sku:
                      type: string
```


The expectation used by the consumer when stubbing out the Products API Backend looks something like this:

```json
{
  "http-request": {
    "headers": {
      "X-auth-token": "abc 123"
    },
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/products"
  },
  "http-response": {
    "status": 200,
    "body": [
      {
        "name": "Rice",
        "sku": "sku123"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note how the consumer sends the header `X-auth-token` in the request. The API gateway replaces it at runtime with `X-internal-id`, and forwards the request to the backend (note that the specification declares the header `X-internal-id`, not `X-auth-token`).

The specification as-is will not accept the above frontend expectation, without a small modification, which can be achieved using Specmatic's `stub_load_contract` hook.

Create the `specamtic.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "provider": "git",
      "consumes": [
        "products.yaml"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hooks": {
    "stub_load_contract": "python3 header.py"
  }
}
```

Create a file named header.py in the root of your project, with the following code:

```python
import os
import sys
import yaml

def main():
    # Read the name of the file from the environment variable
    file_name = os.getenv('CONTRACT_FILE')
    
    if not file_name:
        print("CONTRACT_FILE environment variable not set.")
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            # Load the YAML file
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
            
            # Modify the specified header
            paths = data.get('paths', {})
            products_path = paths.get('/products/{id}', {})
            get_operation = products_path.get('get', {})
            parameters = get_operation.get('parameters', [])
            
            for param in parameters:
                if param.get('in') == 'header' and param.get('name') == 'X-internal-id':
                    param['name'] = 'X-auth-token'
                    break

            # Print the modified data
            print(yaml.dump(data))
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found: {file_name}")
        sys.exit(2)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing file: {e}")
        sys.exit(3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This sample hook code replaces the header name `X-internal-id` with `X-auth-token`.

Now when Specmatic is run in stub mode, it will invoke the hook, pass the specification path to it using through the environment variable `CONTRACT_FILE`, and then load whatever specification is printed by the hook to standard output.

## Precedence across types of examples

There are now several ways in which to provide expectations.

1. Transient expectations
2. Dynamic expectations
3. Static expectations
4. Expectations from examples in the specification

They are resolved in the order in which they appear above.

This means, if a request matches an example in the specification, but also matches a dynamic expectation, the response will be served from the dynamic expectations. Put differently, dynamic expectations override expectations from examples.

## Generating examples

You can generate sample data from a specification as a starting point or scaffolding for your contract tests, using the `examples` command:

```bash
java -jar specmatic.jar examples employees.yaml
```

In the above case, sample files will be written into the directory named `employees_examples`.

## Checking health status of stub server

You can use the `/actuator/health` endpoint to verify if the stub server is operational. To do this, send a GET request to this endpoint using Postman or a curl command. 

The response will provide the current health status of the stub server, indicating whether it is **ready to handle requests**. 
This allows you to confirm that the stub server is up before routing any traffic through it.

#### Example curl Request:
```shell
curl -X GET http://<stub_server_url>/actuator/health
# Example successful response:
# {
#   "status": "UP"
# }
```

Here's the OpenAPI specification describing the `/actuator/health` endpoint.
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3

  title: Health Check API
  description: API for checking the health status of the stub server.
  version: 1.0.0

                    type: string
                    enum:
                      - UP
                    example: UP
```
