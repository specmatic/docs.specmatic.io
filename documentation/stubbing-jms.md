# JMS Stubbing

## Introduction

The JMS standard comprises a set of Java interfaces. It is not a wire protocol. Specmatic uses the ActiveMQ implementation of JMS to stub out JMS dependencies. This can be used anywhere JMS is used, regardless of the specific implementation of JMS in the concerned project.

### Pre-requisite Setup

Below-mentioned dependency needs to be in pom.xml

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>in.specmatic</groupId>
    <artifactId>specmatic-jms</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```    

### Start JMS Server

Below code section shows how to start JMS server.

```
jmsMock = new JmsMock(new ArrayList<String>() {{
    add("src/test/resources/async-api.yaml");
}}, "localhost", 61616);
jmsMock.start();
```

This will start JMS server running on port: 61616 on localhost.

### Stop JMS Server

Below code section shows how to shut-down JMS server.

```
jmsMock.stop();
```

### Creating yaml file

Create a file called `async-api.yaml` in `src/test/resources`(use the same path in step 2) with
the following content.

```
asyncapi: 2.0.0
    info:
        title: JMS Queue Example
        version: '1.0.0'
    servers:
        activemq:
            url: tcp://localhost:61616
            protocol: jms
    channels:
        taskQueueText:
            publish:
                operationId: publishStringMessage
                message:
                    payload:
                        type: string
            bindings:
                amqp:
                    is: queue
```

Above file serves as contract for ActiveMQ server.

### Implementing ActiveMQ server

Create new [TestInitialContextFactory.java](jms-stub-code/TestInitialContextFactory.java) file into src/test/jms package.

This will create ActiveMQ server for which client can interact.

### Changing the JMS Endpoint

Locate `.properties` file, change the value of JMS endpoint `spring.jms.jndi-name` or `spring.datasource.jndi-name`
to `jms.TestInitialContextFactory`(fully qualified class path).
Above approach is specific to JMS with JNDI, approach would be different for other implementations to consume ActiveMQ JMS client.
On running application, JMS calls are redirected to newly created server.

## Stubbing out interactions

* Verification of stub interactions is coming soon.
* For now, a channel will always represent a queue(e.g. testQueueText represents a queue).
* Update the async-api.yaml and add blocks for all the queues that this application will write to.

## Note

* The current version of `specmatic-jms` at time of writing is 0.0.1, but expect this to change when more capabilities are added.
