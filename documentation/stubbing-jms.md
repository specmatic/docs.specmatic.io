# JMS Stubbing

## Introduction

JMS (Java Message Service) is an API that allows application components based on the Java Platform to create, send,
receive, and read messages.

Specmatic internally has support for ActiveMQ JMS client.

### Pre-requisite Setup

Below-mentioned dependency needs to be in pom.xml

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>in.specmatic</groupId>
    <artifactId>specmatic-jms</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```    

### Start JMS Server

Below code section shows how to start JMS server.

```
jmsMock = new JmsMock(new ArrayList<String>() {{
    add("src/test/resources/async-api.yaml");
}}, "localhost", 61616);
jmsMock.start();
```

* This will start JMS server running on port: 61616 on localhost.

### Stop JMS Server

Below code section shows how to shut-down JMS server.

```
jmsMock.stop();
```

### Creating yaml file

Create a file called `async-api.yaml` in `src/test/resources`(use the same path in [step 2](#Start JMS Server) ) with
the following content.

```
asyncapi: 2.0.0
    info:
        title: JMS Queue Example
        version: '1.0.0'
    servers:
        activemq:
            url: tcp://localhost:61616
            protocol: jms
    channels:
        taskQueueText:
            publish:
                operationId: publishStringMessage
                message:
                    payload:
                        type: string
            bindings:
                amqp:
                    is: queue
```

Above file serves as contract for ActiveMQ server.

### Implementing ActiveMQ server

Create new [TestInitialContextFactory.java](jms-stub-code/TestInitialContextFactory.java) file into src/test/jms;

This will create ActiveMQ server for which client can interact.

### Changing the JMS Endpoint

Locate `.properties` file, change the value of JMS endpoint `spring.jms.jndi-name` or other custom property
to `jms.TestInitialContextFactory`(fully qualified class path).
On running application, JMS calls are redirected to newly created server.

## Stubbing out interactions

* Verification of stub interactions is coming soon.
* For now, a channel represents a queue (e.g. tastQueueText represents a queue).
* Update the above file and add blocks for all the queues that this application will write to.
