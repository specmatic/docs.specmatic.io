Migration Guide
===============

`Qontract` has been renamed to `Specmatic`.

Here are a few considerations you will need to keep in mind.

`.spec` is the new extension for contract files. When using proxy mode, Postman conversion, stub conversion or WSDL conversion, contracts will have the `.spec` extension. The `.qontract` extension is still supported, so existing contracts do not need to be renamed.

Here is a list of things that have changed.
1. The binary is now named specmatic.jar.
   1. Any staging environment wrapper scripts referring to qontract.jar will now need to refer to specmatic.jar.
   2. Local wrappers or aliases referring to qontract.jar will need to be updated.
   3. CI scripts referring to qontract.jar will need to be updated.
2. `QontractJUnitSupport` has become `SpecmaticJUnitSupport`.
3. `qontract-core` has become `specmatic-core`.
4. `qontract.json` needs to be renamed to `specmatic.json`.
5. A few XML names have changed (e.g. `qontract_type` is now `specmatic_type`) so WSDLs may have to be regenerated.
