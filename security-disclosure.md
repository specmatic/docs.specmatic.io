# Security Disclosure Process

## Our Commitment to Security

At **Specmatic.io**, we are committed to building secure software and fostering a secure ecosystem. We deeply value the
contributions of security researchers and community members who help us improve the safety and reliability of our tools.

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in Specmatic, its dependencies, or associated infrastructure, we ask
that you report it to us **responsibly and privately**. This helps us investigate and fix the issue before details are
made public, protecting users and downstream projects.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly** until we have had a chance to investigate and issue a fix.
2. Send a detailed report to us at:

   ðŸ“§ **security@specmatic.io**

   Include:
    - A clear description of the issue
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
    - Any proof-of-concept code or exploit (if applicable)
    - The version(s) of Specmatic affected
    - Your contact information (optional, if you'd like credit or follow-up)

## What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within **2 business days**.
2. **Triage**: The issue will be assessed and prioritized based on its severity and impact.
3. **Remediation**: If valid, we will begin developing a fix, and may ask for clarification or additional details.
4. **Release**: A patch will be released in accordance with
   our [Vulnerability Remediation SLA](vulnerability-remediation-sla.html).
5. **Credit** *(optional)*: We may acknowledge your responsible disclosure in our release notes or on a hall of fame
   page, if desired.

## Guidelines for Responsible Disclosure

We ask that researchers:

- Do not attempt to access or modify user data that does not belong to you.
- Avoid actions that could cause service disruption (e.g., DDoS, brute force).
- Act in good faith and give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue.

We are committed to working with researchers in a respectful, timely, and fair manner, and we do not pursue legal action
against those who follow this process in good faith.
